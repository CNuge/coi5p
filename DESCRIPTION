Title: Contextualization And Evaluation of COI-5P Barcode Data
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Cameron M. Nugent
Maintainer: Cameron M. Nugent <nugentc@uoguelph.ca>
Description: 
    coil is an R package designed for the cleaning, contextualization and assessment of cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcode data (COI-5P, or the five prime portion of COI). It contains functions for placing COI-5P barcode sequences into a common reading frame, translating DNA sequences to amino acids and for assessing the likelihood that a given barcode sequence includes an insertion or deletion error. These functions are provided as a single-function pipeline and are also available individually for efficient and targeted analysis of barcode data.
